HW 6

### Overview
* This assignment uses GIPHY API to create a dynamic web page that populates the page with 10 gifs with a corresponding rating every time you click on a button with a certain topic. The gifs that appear will be related to the topic on the button you click. There are four predefined topics to choose from:

   * 1. Dogs 
   * 2. Cats
   * 3. Walrus
   * 4. Chicken
* More topic buttons can be appended onto the page by typing any key word or phrase and clicking the 'add button' button. After clicking the button, a topic button will be appear next to the buttons already present at the topic of the screen. When you click on the added topic button, 10 gifs related to that topic will appear along with their respective ratings.

* When one clicks on the gifs, the gif will stop animating and will become still. To animate the gif again, simply click on the gif once more.

* Every time a new topic button is clicked, the gifs that are currently on the screen will be replaced with gifs related to the topic of the button that was clicked.
